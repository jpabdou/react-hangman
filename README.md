This was a continuation of an earlier solo project in learning React.

Play Hangman here: https://react-hangman-ten.vercel.app

How to play:
You are given a word hidden with "*" characters and the goal of the game is to guess the word with 6 failed tries permitted.

Enter a single lowercase letter as your guess in the input form and click the "submit" button. If you enter a non-lowercase letter or more than 1 letter, the button will grey out and you will be told how to fix your guess.

If your guess is correct, the corresponding "*" characters will be replaced with the letter found within the hidden word. If the guess is incorrect, the Hangman will fill out and you will be notified you one less try left. If neither of these outcomes happen, check that you didn't already guess the letter within the guess history below the guess input form. The game is set to not update with repeat guesses.

Whether you win or lose, click the "Play again?" button to play a new Hangman game.
