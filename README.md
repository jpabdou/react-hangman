This was a continuation of an earlier solo project in learning React.

Play Hangman here: https://react-hangman-ten.vercel.app

How to play:
You are given a hidden word with "*" characters to guess with 6 failed tries permitted.

Enter a single lowercase letter as your guess in the input form and click the "submit" button. If you enter a non-lowercase letter or more than 1 letter, the button will grey out and you will be told how to fix your guess.

If your guess is correct, the corresponding "*" characters will be replaced with the letter found within the hidden word.

Whether you win or lose, click the "Play again?" button to play a new Hangman game.
